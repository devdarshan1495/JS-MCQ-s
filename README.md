## Bonus Conceptual Questions: Mandatory
1. Why is using let safer than var?
let is block-scoped, which means it only works inside the block where it’s declared. This prevents accidental overwrites or bugs that can happen with var, which is function-scoped and can leak outside blocks.

2. What is the main benefit of separating JavaScript from HTML?
It keeps the code clean and organized. HTML handles the structure, CSS handles the style, and JavaScript handles behavior. This makes the code easier to read, maintain, and reuse.

3. Why is Math.random() useful in games or UI effects?
It helps add randomness, like choosing a random enemy, color, or animation. This makes games and interfaces feel more dynamic and fun.

4. What happens if two event listeners are attached to the same element?
Both will run in the order they were added. This allows you to build complex behavior step by step, but you must manage them carefully to avoid unexpected results.

5. Why should we use functions to organize code?
Functions group related code into reusable blocks. This makes the code easier to understand, reduces repetition, and helps you fix or update logic in just one place.
